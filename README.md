===============================================================================

This goal of this project was to get a feel for the different jQuery methods.
Each jQuery function is wrapped up in a click function so that when a button
is clicked, it is easy to see what each method does.

This project was completed while I was a student in The Iron Yard's Front End
Engineeering course.
